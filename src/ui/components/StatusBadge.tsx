 * State of an OpenSVC object: a shape, a tint and a label, without a coloured
 * background. The shape tells the states apart without colour, to stay readable for
 * colour blindness or greyscale printing.
 *
 * Fixed width, cut for the longest label ("stdby down"): in a column, the badges
 * line up as a regular block, glyphs included, whatever the state. `label` replaces
 * the label of the state when the agent's value is more precise, such as "stdby up"
 * shown with the shape of "up".
